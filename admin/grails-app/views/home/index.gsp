         <p>
           This is the administrative interface for the Local Information Store. This site has been set up as a part
           of the Open Data initiative in Sheffield. In discussions, we've identified a number of issues which 
           interrupt the clean flow of non-personal information about the local region through council mediated 
           services. In particular the closed nature of many platforms used by the local authority means that its
           very difficult to volunteer effort to fix data problems or to re-purpose information which has been
           collected for the express purpose of improving the lives of citizens.
         </p>

         <p>
           This part of the application is targeted at those in local authorities who are tasked with maintaining any database of
           local resources such as clubs, events, societies, amienities and services. We're aiming to bridge the gap between
           those who collect and maintain this information, and those who wish to reuse and repurpose it for novel and innovative
           applications. Our aim is to provide a cloud based freemium service which will enable local database providers to
           maintain and publish information in a secure but also open way. We want the information to be owned by the people it belongs
           to, not the application developers, and we want the software to be open so anyone can take and reuse it.
         </p>

           The site is organised around the concept of an "Authority" - An authority takes responsibility for a database of information,
           for example "The Sheffield Help Yourself" database could be considered an authority. Data managers who manage databases can sign up
           using the register link, and then create a new authority. Once you have created a new authority you are able to create new records
           or bulk scrape existing published databases.
