           This site organises information by authorities who manage and coordiate related sets of information. These authorities take
           responsibility for curating and organising data in a particular place and/or domain. For example, Family Information In Sheffield
           might have a SheffieldFIS authority. Exeter Adult Social Care might have ExeterASC. Users can search for existing authorities
           in their locality and request association, or request a new authority be created.
           Search existing authorities here, and request a new one if you are unable to locate your own group</p>
