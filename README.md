This is the readme for the _Trusted Local Information_ (tli) project. TLI is a platform for any organisation wishing to collate, manage and share civic information. Examples of such collections might include Citizens Information Datatabases managed by local library authorities, Childcare provision registers maintained by Family Service Units and Databases of Clubs and Events maintained by civic marketing departments.

The platform itself is Open Source, and freely downloadable and usable. It is maintained by the Sheffield Open Data group (An activity under the Better With Data Society banner)

The driving principle behind TLI is that information collated and maintained by public bodies should be freely available to the public whos taxes pay for that service to reuse and innovate with openly.

The system itself is split into two major components - 

1) An administrative application which suports federated authentication of multiple authorities and/or departments. The system could be used to create a national database, and delegate the management of regional collections to local staff. Within these authorities, seperate hierarchical structures can be set up. The primary goal is to create a network-effect of public information maintainers whereby the workload of keeping information up to date is shared fairly amongst information owners and maintainers. Loaded records are cross-referenced with controlled vocabularies like the UK IPSV/GCL

The administrative system exposes an open data interface which publishes the maintained records as linked open data.

An agent consumes the open data feed and uses this data to populate:

2) An end user information portal which allows the public a faceted search the collections using keyword and spatal search.

It's a bit like "Ask a library" but for maintaining directories of civic and citizens information.

Future Developments

* More granular control of information publishing

* Development of a national federated identity service which can underpin an evolving culture of information stewardship in public services.
